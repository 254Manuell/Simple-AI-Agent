## Highlights 🔍

### ✅ Successful Components

These parts of the project run flawlessly, showcasing the intended functionality:
- **Data Collection**: Scripts gather real-time data from memecoin APIs.
- **Trend Analysis**: Using AI to detect significant patterns.
- **Visualization**: Interactive graphs that depict market movements.

### ⚠️ Error-Prone Components

Some sections have errors, which are valuable learning opportunities. Here's what went wrong and why:

1. **Error in Data Parsing**:
   - **Issue**: The code failed to handle unexpected API responses.
   - **Cause**: Insufficient error handling for malformed data.
   - **Fix**: Introduce data validation checks before processing.

2. **Model Training Failure**:
   - **Issue**: The AI model didn't converge during training.
   - **Cause**: Suboptimal hyperparameters and inadequate dataset size.
   - **Fix**: Optimize hyperparameters and increase training data diversity.
